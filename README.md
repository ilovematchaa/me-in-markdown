## Introduction

Hello, my name is Audrey Tran. I like to listen to music and go shopping. I also enjoy photography. I like to take pictures with my camera. I have one older brother, Brandon. He graduated from Chatsworth 2 years ago. He goes to UCSD and majors in nano tech engineering.

I listen to many differnt genres and artists. Some of my favorite artists are TheWeekend, PartyNextDoor, Bruno Mars, and Billie Eillish. I listen to music because its very calming to me and I like singing the songs. I like hanging with my friends and going to different places with them. I also like movies and going to the movie theatre. Some of my favorite movies include all of the "Descendants" movies, except the 4th movie, "Teen Beach," spiderman movies, "Lilo & Stitch," "The Devil Wears Prada," and "Princess Diaries."
